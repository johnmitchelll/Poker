This is an ongoing and open source project, all bugs and/or feedback you have with the site please reach out to john.mitchell.web@gmail.com

  I started this project in August 2023 trying to create a respectable Poker AI for No Limit Heads-up Texas Hold'em. After I got that working to my standards I showed my friends and also added features for users to create accounts to track their progress over time and against the other users. Going from there I added mini games like Slots and Kuhn Poker. My latest endevor has been to add multiplayer for concurrent users to give a try at playing heads up against each other. In the future I want to add Black Jack as well as the ability to play against more than one other person while sitting at the table.
